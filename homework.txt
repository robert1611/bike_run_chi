The attached csv files have data for the 2013 calendar year.
 - Create a flask application
 - Add a model for your Divvy table based on the .csv
 - Connect your flask app to a database via SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
 - Run your migrations
 - Import the attached DivvyChallenge.csv file into new table in database.
 - Using Flask, create a REST API endpoint (aka route) that accepts 'starttime' and 'endtime' parameters and returns the average duration for that time span in the response.
If you have time:
 - Update the endpoint to accept a  'from_station_id' parameter that further filters the results by the stations that the trip started from.  Include the id and name of the station in the response.
